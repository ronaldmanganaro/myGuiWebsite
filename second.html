Assignment 2: Creating your first webpage
Ronald Manganaro, Umass Lowell Computer Science
Date: September 6, 2016

Description:
For the purposes of assignment 2 please ignore this page.
This is a very simple showing that I know how to create
another webpage. The page has all the tags discussed in
class along with a link back to the index.page. I have 
verified the page with W3C Markup validation service.

<html>
  <head>
    <title>Hello World #2</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>This is the second page!</h1>
    <p> You made it! Click <a href="index.html">here</a> to go back! Also 
      checkout the W3C validation proof below!</p>
